News - Date: 27 March 2017Written by: Elmon Tshikhudo / Viewed: 114Rural maize farmers in Vhembe were told to start seed stokvels that would help them purchase and curb the spiralling cost of seeds.This was the advice of seed expert&nbsp;Mr Charles Matlou of the Pioneer Seed Company, who addressed farmers during a maize information day held at the local Maraxwe Juventus sports grounds outside Thohoyandou last Tuesday.During the function, experts touched on several issues pertaining to maize farming. If the event is anything to go by, farmers in the area could possibly soon be smiling all the way to the bank and competing with other provinces in terms of maize production.The event is the initiative of the Department of Agriculture and seed manufacturing company Pioneer Seeds. Hundreds of farmers from villages such as Mutshenzheni, Mbahela, Maraxwe, Mianzwi, Tshiombo and Matangari attended the day.Matlou also urged the farmers to start producing maize on a larger scale as the Limpopo province is lagging in terms of maize production. &ldquo;People do not default in paying clubs for groceries, funerals and other things.&nbsp;Why can&rsquo;t you start a stokvel that would help you in purchasing seeds?&nbsp;You can start saving now, and when the time comes you won&rsquo;t have any problem, you will just go and purchase your seeds and you share accordingly.&rdquo;He also mentioned that it was of great concern that the farmers had&nbsp;land, but this land was not producing anything, with others even quitting farming because they had&nbsp;nothing to show.Experts from different companies made presentations during the event. One of the coordinators, Mr Calvin Netshithuthuni, an agricultural extension officer, said the event came about as a way of empowering local farmers and making&nbsp;them aware of the new developments in the maize-production sector. &quot;There are new developments in maize production that come daily. Climate change has affected production on a bigger scale, so&nbsp;that farmers are finding it hard to cope,&rdquo; he added.Mr Mpho Mabuduga represented NTK Muledane, while Mr Converse Nekhwevha spoke on behalf of Thohoyandou Farm City. They both told farmers that they were available and their doors were open&nbsp;and they would assist them free of charge on the different challenges they might have as farmers.Chief Tovhowani Mathoho thanked the organisers of the event, saying what they had&nbsp;learnt would go a long way in improving production of maize in their areas.&nbsp;&quot;We are excited about this initiative and not long from now we will transform from subsistence to commercial farmers and make money from our produce,&quot; he said.&nbsp;Seed expert Charles Matlou shows&nbsp;some of the maize cultivars that give&nbsp;a big yield.The Matangari Service Centre Pioneer Maize seed trial team that is doing the experiment and working with the communities.&nbsp;Here they are photographed with Chief Tovhowani Mathoho of Tshiombo.Part of the group of farmers, Tshiombo traditional leader Chief Tovhowani Mathoho, officials and guests during the event.Messrs Charles Matlou (left) of Pioneer Seeds and Converse Nekhwevha of Thohoyandou Farm City discuss an insecticide with the farmers.
