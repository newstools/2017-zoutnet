We have put aside R8 million secured from the Municipal Infrastructure Grant (MIG) for this project. &nbsp;This will go a long way in coming up with solutions to the problem of gravel roads on a case-by-case basis.&rdquo;Mr Samuel Mudau is a taxi driver who operates his taxi in Nancefield on a&nbsp;daily basis, and he said that the construction of the paved access road was&nbsp;good news to the motorists. &ldquo;Besides increasing the lifespan of our vehicles, we will be able to make more income, because we will take more loads of passengers within a very short space of time.&rdquo;&nbsp;Construction work on&nbsp;the 1,6km paved road project is progressing well in Musina Nancefield Extension 6 and 7.Correspondent journalists&nbsp;from all over the region supply us with news and sport articles.&nbsp;Email: news@zoutnet.co.za
