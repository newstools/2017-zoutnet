The rocky and bumpy condition of the road has been a cause of concern for Ramalata and other local community members within Ward 10 of Musina Municipality.This handicap may be soon a thing of the past, as the Musina Municipality recently commissioned the upgrading of the 12km road between Tshipise and Matatani.&ldquo;We really welcome this project with open arms because we have been waiting for many years. Along with prolonging the lifespan of our vehicles, it will make our lives easier as we will be able to move from one place to another easily. This makes us very happy and thankful,&rdquo; said Ramalata.Municipal spokesperson&nbsp;Wilson Dzebu said the municipality had&nbsp;secured a total of R7,8million from the municipal infrastructure grant to fund the long-awaited project. &ldquo;Local community members, visitors and tourists have raised concerns about the condition of this road for some time. We advised villagers to put the road project as one of their priorities in the municipal integrated development plan,&nbsp;so that it can be funded as soon as the money is available.&rdquo;Dzebu said the scope of work includes ground levelling, re-gravelling, the construction of a bridge and several culverts. &ldquo;This is a great step in advancing mobility, tourism and bettering the lives of the local communities. This is one of the busiest roads in Ward 10 and it needs to be taken care of, so that service delivery can be accessed with ease. On top of all this, the project has created job opportunities for local people who had been unemployed before. They will also be empowered with the skills they will use to provide for themselves after the completion of the project.&rdquo;The upgrading of the Tshipise-Matatani access road has brought joy to the communities of Ward 10 of Musina Municipality.Correspondent journalists&nbsp;from all over the region supply us with news and sport articles.&nbsp;Email: news@zoutnet.co.za
