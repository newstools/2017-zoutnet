News - Date: 23 June 2017Written by: Kaizer Nengovhela / Viewed: 19The ANC&nbsp;Vhembe&#39;s regional conference, which was called off earlier this month, is scheduled to take place on Friday (23rd) and Saturday (24th) at Tshedza Lodge in Louis Trichardt.The conference was scheduled for 2 and 3 June, but was postponed after several disruptions. The meeting was marked by squabbles between delegates&nbsp;over the accreditation of members. Two contesting factions clashed over which regional executive committee members should be allowed to vote at the conference.The ANC&rsquo;s constitution states that at least 10% of the voting delegates should come from the Regional Executive Committee, the Women&rsquo;s League and the Youth League.Sources from within the party said this week that the committee was divided into two factions - one supporting former Vhembe District Mayor&nbsp;Tshitereke Matibe and the other backing his challenger, former Thulamela Municipal&nbsp;Manager and provincial ANC spokesperson&nbsp;Adv Makonde Mathivha. The committee apparently failed to reach consensus on which 23 of its 26 members should be allowed to vote.The Regional Executive Committee were called in by the provincial structure to address the issues and it was agreed that the conference should go ahead this weekend.Kaizer Nengovhela started writing stories for Limpopo Mirror more than a decade ago, in 2 000.
