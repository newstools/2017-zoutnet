News - Date: 24 June 2017Written by: Elmon Tshikhudo / Viewed: 1175The Muligwe and Mahematshena communities, who have been without traditional leadership for years, had something to smile about at the weekend.History was made when two chiefs under Lwamondo senior traditional leader Thovhele Ndaedzo Nelwamondo were installed in one ceremony.Chief Ndalamo&nbsp;Muligwe (48) was installed as chief of Ha&nbsp;Muligwe. His ndumi is Mr Obed Muligwe, while Ms Nyawasedza Masia was made khadzi to the new chief. Muligwe succeeds his late father, Chief Freddy Muligwe, who&nbsp;passed on in 2003.During the same ceremony, Ms&nbsp;Phophi Nyambeni (70) was installed as chief of Mahematsheni and was given a new royal name, Vhamusanda Vho Nthuseni.&nbsp;Her khadzi is Ms Tshinyadzo Ralineba Nelwamondo. Mr Norman Nelwamondo was made the ndumi. Chief Nthuseni Nyambeni succeeds her uncle, Chief Tshisikhawe Nelwamondo, who passed on many years ago.Among the guests were traditional leaders such as Thovhele Thivhulawi Makumbane of Tshisahulu, many community members, friends and family members.&nbsp;The installation rites were performed by Chief Lutombo Tshisudzungwane, the chairperson of the Lwamondo traditional council.Tshisudzungwane urged the two chiefs to lead an exemplary life in order to earn the respect they deserve from their subjects.&nbsp;&quot;To be respected, be role models, listen to your subjects, treat them equally. Know that any bad thing you do will reflect negatively on Thovhele Nelwamondo, as you are his face here,&quot; he said.He told the youthful Chief Muligwe not to womanise, as that led to the downfall of strong men in Biblical times.&nbsp;He added that, should he need to marry, he should not go to taverns to get a wife and that there were protocols to be followed the royal way.Chief Lutombo Tshisudzungwane (standing) conducts&nbsp;the installation rites during the ceremony.
