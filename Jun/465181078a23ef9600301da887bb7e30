The event was organised by the Charismatic Rhythms under the theme 1976 Today &ndash; Arise, young person, arise!&ldquo;We decided to host a concert where the youth&nbsp;could interact among themselves, led by experienced youth culture experts,&rdquo; the director for Charismatic Rhythms, Kagiso Kekana, said. &ldquo;Unless youths engage one another in themes related to Youth Day in remembrance of the youths of 1976, they will know less history about the day and then all meaning of the Soweto uprising and history gets lost along the way.&rdquo;She added that when youths lost&nbsp;focus on the basis and meaning of Youth Day, they started to celebrate the day through alcohol and drugs in places where violence and disorder became the order of the day for them.&ldquo;The purpose of the event was to engage our young people by telling the history of our fallen young leaders and to motivate our current ones to utilise the freedom that was once fought for them to the best of their abilities to create a sustainable future for themselves and generations to come,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;Here in the Makhado municipal area, at Tshikota Community Hall, parents and community leaders enjoyed themselves as Charismatic Rhythms members performed their various art pieces such as kwela dance and stage plays,&rdquo; Kekana said. &ldquo;They expressed their feelings regarding the memorial of the Soweto uprising.&rdquo;The guests included Cllr Martha Babadu, who marvelled at the energy and talent that the youths of Makhado displayed. She said that the audience development for performance art was needed in the community.&nbsp;One parent, Ms Takalani Tshinesa, said that the community needed more events of this kind, not only during Youth Month but through the year.&ldquo;Our youths are getting lost,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They are busy with substance abuse whereas there are so many activities to keep them&nbsp;busy. So, as the community, we need to join hands with the youth&nbsp;and instil a sense of positive lifestyle&nbsp;among them. Let&#39;s encourage them to go to school and follow their dreams.&rdquo;Charismatic Rhythms continues to build and shape the lives of youths in communities, and those interested in the activities of Charismatic Rhythms can contact them at kkekana65@yahoo.com.Photographed during the event are (from left to right) Takalani Tshinesa,&nbsp;Valelani Funyufunyu,&nbsp;Elekanyani Netshakhuma and Kagiso Kekana.&nbsp;Some of the youths who participated in 1976 Today &ndash; Arise, young person, arise!&nbsp;in Tshikota on Friday.Tshifhiwa Given Mukwevho was born in 1984 in Madombidzha village, not far from Louis Trichardt in the Limpopo Province.
