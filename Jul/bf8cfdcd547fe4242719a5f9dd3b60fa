News - Date: 01 July 2017 Written by: Kaizer Nengovhela / Viewed: 893 Mr Lutendo Ramahala (28) of Vhumatshelo Crop Farming at Tshikhwani was recognised as the best young farmer during the National Youth in Agriculture Fisheries and Forestry competition held at the Kieviets Kroon Country Estate in Pretoria last Friday. Ramahala won the smallholder category and received R50 000 and a certificate. During the event, the Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Bheki Cele, said that his department wanted to assist young people, particularly those from previously disadvantaged rural areas, in their farming endeavours. According to him, emerging farmers are playing an important role in food production. He encouraged young people to become involved by starting gardens at the back of their houses. "We appreciate and value the contribution of young people in economic activities of the province," said Cele. Ramahala farms with spinach and tomatoes and sells these to a big supermarket and to members of the community. He currently employs five people.
