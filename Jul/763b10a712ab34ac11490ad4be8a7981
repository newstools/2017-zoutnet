News - Date: 06 July 2017Written by: Elmon Tshikhudo / Viewed: 202The community of Shingwedzi High School in Malamulele in the new Lim345 municipality were over the moon when a group of former pupils visited the school.The former learners who are succeeding in their respective fields, on Friday came back to the school and presented the pupils with gifts.The group, led by Prof Barry Hanyane, arrived at the school with a load full of toiletries, underwear for the boys, full school uniforms for many learners, body lotion, lots of second hand clothing and other stuff which they handed over to the needy learners.Hanyane said as products of the school they felt indebted to the school and thought of ploughing back to the school that shaped their lives. &ldquo;We know of the conditions here in the rural areas as we experienced this personally. Poverty is at its worst in these areas and we felt we should do something for our brothers and sisters at this school which made us what we are today.&rdquo;He emphasised the importance of the school in their foundation years and said the school gave them a sanctuary and refuge when they were young.Mr Patrick Shivambu, deputy principal, could not hide his excitement. &ldquo;It is so humbling to find that learners you have taught are succeeding in life. We have 1 231 learners here and most of them are from very disadvantaged backgrounds and cannot afford most of the things. We are very grateful for what these former learners have done for our school.&rdquo;Beneficiaries, school staff and the former pupils pose happily during the visit at the school.
