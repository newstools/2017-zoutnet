He and an entourage visited the Matsila area on Tuesday on a fact-finding and networking mission.

We have learnt a lot from his model of development and agriculture that we will implement back home.&rdquo;According to him, what impressed them the most was the fact that the projects created a lot of employment opportunities for&nbsp;the locals. &ldquo;With more than 500 working opportunities, we feel if all chiefs can do this in their areas, our communities could say goodbye to poverty,&quot; he said.He further indicated that he had had time to share ideas with Chief Matsila.&nbsp;&quot;As traditional leaders, we must help each other and not for our own sake but to improve the lives of our subjects, &quot; added Maphumulo.The host, Chief Livhuwani Matsila, said it was humbling and encouraging to have such a senior traditional leader from the Zulu Kingdom attracted to what was happening in his area. &quot;This shows that we are going in the right direction in terms of improving the lives of our subjects.&quot;According to him, the fact that people from different areas are prepared to learn from each other serves &quot;as a clear indication that we are one as South Africans and that tribalism will not find space in this country.
