News - Date: 13 July 2017Written by: Anton van Zyl / Viewed: 45In last week&rsquo;s edition of the Zoutpansberger it was reported that Mr Wally Schultz had been re-elected as chairperson of the local AfriForum branch. Based on comments Mr Schultz made on social media, this is not true. On his Facebook comments Mr Schultz wrote that he had merely received a &ldquo;unanimous vote&rdquo; of support from his committee members.Last Tuesday, Mr Schultz sent an email to the Zoutpansberger with a photo of AfriForum Louis Trichardt&rsquo;s executive committee. The information accompanying the photo was very brief, stating that &ldquo;The local branch of AfriForum have voted unanimously in a vote of full confidence in Wally Schultz as chairman of AfriForum Louis Trichardt.&rdquo; It then gives the names of the people in the photo.Mr Schultz was asked this week to provide clarity on what the committee or the members had been asked to vote on, if not for portfolios on the committee. He chose not to respond on record and ascribed the erroneous report as a misunderstanding between him and the newspaper. He did mention that the Afriforum committee will meet this week to decide on a date for an annual general meeting. &ldquo;This will be forwarded to you,&rdquo; he promised.On Wednesday morning, Mr Johan Fourie, a member of the Exco, sent through a notice stating that the branch&rsquo;s annual general meeting will take place on Tuesday, 1 August, at 18:00 at the Soutpansberg Golf Club&rsquo;s hall. Apart from the chairperson&rsquo;s report, the committee will also give feedback about the water crisis in town. A new chairperson and executive committee will have to be elected.Anton van Zyl has been with the Zoutpansberger and Limpopo Mirror for over 25&nbsp;years.
