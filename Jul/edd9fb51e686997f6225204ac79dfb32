News - Date: 01 July 2017 Written by: Silas Nduvheni / Viewed: 301 More than 100 members of the Mutale Bee Keepers Cooperative received official recognition from the government. They received certificates of registration during an information day at the Mutale agricultural offices last Friday. The agricultural advisor in Mutale, Mr Richard Nekhavhambe, said that the Mutale area, especially the Balethavha area, had a high potential for beekeeping. In the Niani area, the department of agriculture wants to focus on the stingless bee, also called monga in Tshivenda. The chairperson of the Mutale Bee Keeping Cooperative, Mr Daniel Khakhu, said that they were excited about the government's recognition. According to him, they believe that bee keeping in the Mutale area will progress, due to the high demand for honey from local communities. “We are unable to supply our customers in and around Mutale and Vhembe, and we are running short of honey.” Khakhu said the bee keeping is an easy business, because “the bees are just working on your behalf, and yours is only to monitor and harvest.” The assistant director in the Department of Agriculture's Mutale region, Ms Tendani Lambani, presents certificates of recognition to Vhamusanda Vho-Sampson Rambuda, while some members of the Bee Keeping Cooperative.
