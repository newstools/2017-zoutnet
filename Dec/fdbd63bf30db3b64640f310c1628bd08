News - Date: 23 December 2017 Written by: Maanda Bele / Viewed: 550 Thendo Given Mafanedza, a Grade 11 learner at Gumani Technical High, appealed to members of the public to fund his innovative science projects. “I love solving problems through technology. I have solved many problems in the area where I live by using my innovative mind,” said the 18-year-old from Khubvi. “I want my projects to be registered and go on to solve the problems that the world is facing. I believe that we can solve everything through technology and make the world a better place to live in,” he said. According to Thendo, his science projects are making life much easier at his church and school. “At my school we had a bell ringer problem. The bell switch was at the principal’s office, so the bell ringer had to travel all the way to the office to ring the bell, meaning that he would miss some part of the lessons. I came up with a solution by inventing a system that controls the bell, using a remote switch,” Thendo explained. “I have also innovated a people counter at my church, which helps to count people who are entering and leaving the church.” He said he was currently busy building a telescope at his home, so that community members can see and learn about the solar system. His inspiration is Ndivhuwo Makondo, a researcher in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics at the CSIR in Pretoria. Thendo can be contacted at: Thendomaftech@gmail.com.
