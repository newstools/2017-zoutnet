News - Date: 02 December 2017 Written by: Isabel Venter / Viewed: 268 As the year draws to a close, the criminal case against a renowned figure in local education circles has yet to be finalized. The 50-year-old Rev (Dr) Ntavhanyeni Sampie Phaswana appeared in the Louis Trichardt Magistrate Court several times the past year on a charge of the unlawful discharging of a firearm. His first court appearance was in January. The charge relates to an incident during which Phaswana allegedly threatened to shoot his neighbour. The neighbour testified in court that Phaswana came to her house because he claimed that her child is bullying his child. An argument ensued during which Phaswana allegedly threatened to shoot her and her child. During Phaswana’s last court appearance, on 15 November, his case was postponed because the police officer testifying for the State was not available. It is expected that this witness will come and testify on 16 January 2018, after which the case will be closed in order for the court to give judgement. Rev (Dr) Ntavhanyeni Sampie Phaswana.   Isabel joined the Zoutpansberger and Limpopo Mirror in 2009 as a reporter. She holds a BA Degree in Communication Sciences from the University of South Africa.
