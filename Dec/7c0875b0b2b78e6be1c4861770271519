This was demonstrated by hundreds of community members who participated in a walk thorough Musina’s CBD to raise awareness against the abuse of women and children last week. The spokesperson of the Musina Municipality, Mr Wilson Dzebu said that the municipality partnered with various non-profit organizations, community structures, ordinary citizens and government departments. Dzebu said it is everyone’s duty to create a society that is free of violence against women and children. “This initiative is very important, because it aims at raising awareness among South Africans about the negative impact of violence against women and children. We hear and read about cases of violence and abuse every day, but we continue pretending that it is not real, simply because it has not affected us personally. You do not have to be in a violent relationship to know that there are women and children who are being abused every day.” He added that South Africa needs men who are responsibly enough to stand together and reject the acts of violence against women and children, and who are courageous to go around spreading the messages of a country free of violence.   Some of the people who participated in the walk to raise awareness against the abuse of women and children.   Email:
