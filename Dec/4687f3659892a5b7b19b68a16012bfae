Thendo Netshiombo is best known for her welding skills. She is no stranger to welding projects and apart from gates, she can also build trailers. She encouraged young people to create their own employment. “Sending out CVs doesn’t guarantee you employment.” she said. “It’s better to create your own job and, who knows, maybe you might employ other people.” Thendo said she became interested in welding when she was staying with her grandfather, who was also a known welder in the community. “I used to sit and watch him make gates and burglar bars. That was when I fell love in with welding.” Even though she faces criticism in her profession, because of her gender, she said it would not stop her from achieving her dreams. “Some people say the job doesn’t suit me because am a girl, but I don't listen to them because I know I am doing this for myself.” she said. “In future, I want to send at least ten people who are less privileged to school.” Besides being a welder, Thendo is also an enthusiastic poet.
