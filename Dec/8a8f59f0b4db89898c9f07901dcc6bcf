He was speaking at the Manenzhe Tribal Council Office during the visit by the mayor of Musina, Cllr Mihloti Muhlope last Wednesday. Manenzhe is one of the five senior traditional leaders who have been allocated seats in the Council of Musina Municipality. “As a member of the municipality Council, I understand how the municipality systems operate. Despite the lack of resources, we can see the progress in our areas under the new political leadership of Musina Municipality. I will continue to work together with the municipality to make sure that my subjects are getting the best government services.” Muhlope said it is important for Musina Municipality to build a good working relationship with the traditional leaders. She added that her visit was also part of the fact-finding mission on the service delivery implementation plan of the municipality. “Before coming to the tribal offices, we visited various projects around this area to assess progress. Time for waiting for reports while seated in the office is a thing of the past. As service delivery agents, we must go all out and meet our communities while at the same time interacting with them.” Chief Mmbangiseni Manenzhe welcomes Mayor Mihloti Muhlope at the Manenzhe Tribal Council's offices.
