News - Date: 21 December 2017 Written by: Tshifhiwa Mukwevho / Viewed: 141 A 41-year-old female suspect, Ms Tshifhiwa Mudau, was granted R1 000 bail after appearing in the Tshitale Magistrate’s Court last Thursday. The court appearance followed after she was arrested in connection with a robbery. She is alleged to have arranged with two unknown men to rob an undisclosed amount from the stokvel of which she was a member. The robbery took place when stokvel members were distributing the stokvel’s savings among themselves at Mailaskop village. According to a statement, Mudau stood up and walked outside, where she made a phone call. When she came in again, the two unknown men entered and robbed the stokvel.  The police in Makhado had since warned robbers to refrain from acts of terrorising stokvel groups. Mudau will appear in court again on 12 February next year.  Tshifhiwa Given Mukwevho was born in 1984 in Madombidzha village, not far from Louis Trichardt in the Limpopo Province.
