News - Date: 03 April 2017Written by: Tshifhiwa Mukwevho / Viewed: 671The sight of a six-year-old child who crawled around home and in the grassy space outside his home caught the eye of a resident of Vleifontein.Ms Rose Mulembamuthihi&#39;s heart then went out to the young boy, Thendo Gift Tshamano. She decided to walk into his home and spend&nbsp;the day with Ms Rebecca Tshamano, the mother of the physically disabled boy. She politely asked why the boy was crawling around in the spiky grass.&ldquo;She told me that he had no wheelchair, and that she couldn&#39;t even afford a pram for him,&rdquo; Mulembamuthihi said. &ldquo;Her story pained me so much and it reminded me of one night when I saw an MEC who was handing over a wheelchair to a disabled person on the TV news.&rdquo;Mulembamuthihi thought that it would bring some relief to the boy&#39;s life if the MEC, whom she didn&#39;t even know, could also provide a wheelchair to him. But she didn&#39;t know how to go about contacting him.&ldquo;So I remembered that there was this one man whom I had watched grow up here in the township,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Even from a young age, he would be going up and down helping people with this or that. The young man in question is Mr Geoffrey Tshibvumo.&rdquo;She phoned Tshibvumo and requested him to arrange a wheelchair for Thendo. Tshibvumo is the chairperson of the DA caucus in the Makhado Municipality. &ldquo;Taking good care of community members, the disabled and the aged is top priority for me as a councillor,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I hereby call on the business community to join me and assist many other disabled people who are in serious need.&rdquo;The boy&#39;s mother, Ms Rebecca Tshamano, thanked the DA for the provision of the wheelchair. She said that she couldn&#39;t have afforded the wheelchair herself because she was unemployed. &ldquo;I wished for my son to have a wheelchair,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;At Elim Hospital they refused to give him a wheelchair, saying that they were only designated for adults and not children. This wheelchair has brought relief to my child, who will now be able to move around in it.&rdquo;Young Thendo Gift Tshamano received his first wheelchair.
