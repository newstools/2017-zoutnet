Zuma described Chabane as &ldquo;my son, my younger brother.&rdquo; He narrated how Chabane was recruited into Umkhonto we Sizwe with others including the late Peter Mokaba. He added that the late Chabane had the qualities that fitted his role as an MK cadre impeccably. &ldquo;He had unique qualities and was quiet,&rdquo; said Zuma. He said that Chabane grew up in the ANC and grew up to become &ldquo;a giant amongst giants&rdquo; of the party.Several speakers praised Zuma for attending the unveiling ceremony at a time he was under attack from several quarters. Hosi Lwandlamuni Nwamitwa, who represented Vatsonga Machangana, said that the president is a man of the people, who is always available when they request a meeting with him.Chabane&rsquo;s tombstone was unveiled at the Xakani burial site near Magomani.
