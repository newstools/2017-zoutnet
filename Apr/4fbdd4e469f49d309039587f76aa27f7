Through these private sector partners, we raised R302 million,&rdquo; he added.Ndou added that RAL will spend R25 million of its allocation to employ local labour during project implementation and has set aside R115 million to support SMME&rsquo;s and further train 480 local workers.He concluded that the Department shall continue to liaise with organizations of people living with disabilities to explore ways of increasing their participation in the various projects being implemented.The MEC of Public Works, Roads and Infrastructure, Mr Jerry NdouThe 22-year-old Mbulaheni (Gary) Ridovhona has been passionate about journalism to the extent that he would buy himself a copy of weekly Univen students&#39; newsletter, Our Voice.
