News - Date: 13 April 2017Written by: Elmon Tshikhudo / Viewed: 521Residents of Vuwani, whose area was merged with areas of Hlanganani and Malamulele to form the new municipality entity, Lim345, are blaming President Jacob Zuma for their woes.The residents, whose area has suffered losses amounting to more than half a billion rand when schools and other properties were set alight and damaged during violent protests last year, have on Friday joined the countrywide chorus that Zuma must be removed as president of the country.&nbsp; The residents say Zuma is taking sides in the Vuwani stalemate, by keeping quiet as if nothing was happening, but he took an active interest when the people of Malamulele were protesting to have their own municipality.Speaking on condition of anonymity,&nbsp;residents said Zuma had visited the area of Malamulele during the height of the protests and promised them that government would intervene.&nbsp;&ldquo;Soon after that, the Demarcation Board ruled in favour of the people of Malamulele.&nbsp;He can do the same here, but because he is corrupt to the core, he is selling the people of Vuwani out,&rdquo; they added.&ldquo;The honourable thing he can do is step down and maybe a new president would be interested in solving this problem,&rdquo; said a community member.Community leader and Pro Makhado Task Team spokesman, Mr Nsovo Sambo said the residents have vowed to continue with a shutdown until their problems are solved. The shutdown will&nbsp;resume after the Easter holidays.Elderly citizens of Vuwani burning Zuma T-shirts during one of the protests. Elmon Tshikhudo started off as a photographer.
