The buildings were old and dilapidated and things worsened after a huge storm that damaged the mud-brick classrooms in 2012, leaving learners without a better place for learning and teaching.&ldquo;We are members of a department that promises decent education. We expect the school to bring better education to enlighten&nbsp;the learners and&nbsp;communities,&rdquo; said Kgetjepe.Chief Thinawanga Randima, the local traditional leader of Khubvi village, congratulated the department for remembering their deep rural community.&quot; We appeal to the learners and communities to treat the school with respect, because it will also be used by future generations,&quot;&nbsp;he said.Learners of Khubvi Primary entertained the people who attended the opening ceremony.
