Stop dating older men for money and material things,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You are not here to collect pregnancies and diseases. Focus on what brings you here, which is to collect your qualifications.&rdquo;She also advised them to stop sleeping with teachers and lecturers in exchange of marks. &ldquo;It will not help you to get anywhere. A teacher can give you free marks from Grade 8 until matric, but those marks will never help you to pass matric,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;Stop selling your body in exchange for material things. Work hard and succeed without donating anything to anyone.&rdquo;She warned the students about the dangers of HIV/Aids. &ldquo;Your families are waiting for you to start earning your own salaries and be independent,&rdquo; she added.The president of the SRC, Mandla Shikwambana, added that the students&rsquo; families were waiting for them to take them out of poverty.
