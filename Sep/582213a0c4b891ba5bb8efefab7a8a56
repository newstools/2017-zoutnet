The padlocks were broken and inside the computer room everything was just upside down.&quot;He added that several boxes of books&nbsp;meant for pupils in the new year were missing &ldquo;and this is of much concern to us as this is disorganizing learning and teaching.&rdquo;He made an appeal to the police to revisit all the old cases and arrest the perpetrators. &ldquo;This has to stop,&quot; said Halata.&nbsp;He further indicated that so many as 11 break inns have happened at the school during his term as chairperson of the SGB.SGB chairperson Mr Shumani Halata shows&nbsp;the boxes of books left by the thieves at the school.
