News in brief - Date: 04 February 2017 Written by: Isabel Venter / Viewed: 12817 The Makhado Police have arrested two people for questioning in connection with the taxi driver that was gunned down in cold blood this morning on the N1 south just outside of Louis Trichardt. The driver has been identified as the 37-year-old Mr Collen Mufunwani. According to provincial spokesperson Brig Motlafela Mojapelo, two suspects boarded Mufunwani’s taxi at Beitbridge. Mufunwani was transporting his passengers to Polokwane.  The two men occupied the seats directly behind him. “At one stage along the way, the two told the deceased to stop as they wanted to relieve themselves and almost every passenger alighted for the same purpose,” said Mojapelo. Near the Fort Edward turn-off the two suspects instructed the Mufunwani to take the turn-off. It was when he allegedly refused to do so that they shot him in the head, killing him instantly. The taxi veered of the road and crashed. “The suspects then vanished into the nearby bushes, taking nothing form Mufunwani,” said Mojapelo. Police resources, including a helicopter, were immediately mobilized to search for the suspects. The Makhado Police also received support from the local farm watch, who helped in the search. Mojapelo confirmed that investigations are still ongoing. A blanket cover the remains of Collen Mufunwani who was gunned down in cold blood this morning. Photo supplied.
