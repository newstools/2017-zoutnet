News in brief - Date: 06 February 2017 Written by: Isabel Venter / Viewed: 705 Residents of Louis Trichardt and the surrounding areas are urged to continue using water sparingly. The newspaper has confirmed reports that work on the Albasini Dam pipeline was continuing Monday to repair more leaks that were discovered over the weekend. “The system is dilapidated so problems and leaks will keep on happening,” said Mr Brian du Plooy, a ward councillor for the Democratic Alliance (DA) in Louis Trichardt. Despite Du Plooy’s warnings, several contractors and managers of the Vhembe District Municipality (VDM) vehemently denied that more leaks were reported. The newspaper spoke to one manager who said that water service delivery has returned to normal since last week. He also confirmed that the water from the Albasini was safe to drink again, since the water filters has been replaced. An official statement from the VDM was pending as the spokesperson was not available for comment on Monday due to a family emergency.
