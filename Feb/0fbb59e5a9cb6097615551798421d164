News in brief - Date: 14 February 2017 Written by: Isabel Venter / Viewed: 1262 The case against three suspected rhino poachers, Onward Muchagowa (34) and Deon (48) and Niklaas van Deventer (51), was adjourned in the Louis Trichardt District Court. It was expected that Niklaas and Muchagowa would proceed with their bail application today, after Deon had finished his application on Monday. One of their attorneys was not feeling well today and asked that the application be postponed until a later date. All three will remain in police custody, however. The trio was arrested early in January after they allegedly discarded a rhino horn from a moving car while police were driving behind them. Deon alleged yesterday while testifying during his bail application that the said rhino horn did not belong to him but to a certain Ruben. He stated that he had intended to contact the police to hand over information about Ruben, and in turn could be registered as a police informant. All three men will appear in court again on 1 March, and again on 6 March when the state prosecutor will give evidence as to why they should not receive bail.
