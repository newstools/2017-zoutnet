The turn up was overwhelming and we are very excited about it,&rdquo; she said.Muhlope said the success of the show was a step forward towards the achievement of city status for Musina. &ldquo;Government has declared Musina as a provincial growth point. Preparations to implement the Special Economic Zone are also at an advanced stage. Initiatives like the show help us to market our municipality, thereby paving the&nbsp;way for us to realize the above visions.&rdquo;She added that the show also yielded positive spin-offs for&nbsp;local entrepreneurs as there were lots of trade activities in the three days of the show.&ldquo;Our tourism industry also benefited a lot as we had thousands of visitors who came to our municipality. We received positive reports that all the local hotels and guest houses were full, thereby giving a boost to our businesspeople. More importantly, our artists also get exposure and it becomes easier for them to acclaim international status.&rdquo;She said the timing of the annual show was right as it came during women&rsquo;s month. &ldquo;We saw a lot of women participating in various activities during the three days of the show. This is the best thing we can do to honour women in our municipality.&rdquo;Apart from exhibitions, fun lovers enjoyed music festivals, wrestling, traditional dancers, musangwe, demonstrations by the South African National Defence Force, merry-go-rounds, theatre, choral music and poetry.DJ Arch Jnr was also part of the entertainers.Mayor Mihloti Muhlope greets fun lovers who attended the official opening of the show.Internationally acclaimed artist&nbsp;Oliver Mtukudzi entertains people during the show.The show would have been incomplete without legendary reggae artist&nbsp;Colbert Mukwevho.Part of the huge crowd that attended the Musina Annual Show.Email:
