News - Date: 21 August 2017Written by: Elmon Tshikhudo / Viewed: 901If the break-in at Tshivhidzo Masiagwala Secondary School at Maungani outside Thohoyandou last Wednesday evening is anything to go by, criminals have really found a fertile hunting ground.The school has been broken into five times in recent times and in most of the break-ins&nbsp;desktop computers and laptops were the items that were stolen. So far, more than 20 computers, donated by individuals and businesses, have been stolen.The latest theft targeted computer hard drives and food meant for the learners&#39; feeding scheme.&nbsp;Wi-fi equipment, installed only last month at a cost of R6 500, was also stolen.The chairperson of the school governing body (SGB), Mr Shumani Halata, said he received a call from the deputy principal of the school at about 06:30. &quot;I was told of the incident and rushed to the school to find everything upside down. There were open cases of computers whose hard drives were stolen. Food was strewn all over up to the main gate.&quot;Mr Thompson Netshitanini, another member of the SGB, expressed his disappointment. &quot;These hooligans do not have mercy. Our Grade 12s must start with their examinations soon and this means they will be left behind and might be negatively affected by the incident.&quot;&nbsp;He added that the information on the computers was very valuable and, in some instances, irreplaceable.The spokesperson for the Department of Education, Dr Naledzani Rasila, described the incident as very unfortunate. He said that it was regrettable that the department could&nbsp;not hire security for the school as a result of&nbsp;budget constraints.The whole computer room was upside down with computers whose hard drives were removed during the burglary.Community leaders Cllr Thembani Chitiba (left), Mr Thompson Netshitanini (centre) and Mr Hulisani Halata (SGB chairperson)&nbsp;look&nbsp;at the left-over food in&nbsp;the school&#39;s store room.&nbsp; Elmon Tshikhudo started off as a photographer.
