During the handing-over ceremony, Mr&nbsp;Londolani Rampfumedzi said it was&nbsp;20 years since he had left school, but after a discussion with a former classmate, they decided to help their former school. &quot;This does not mean that we have lots of money, but we are here to give support to the learners and staff. Mbilwi has become a big brand and we should assist in keeping it afloat.&rdquo;School principal&nbsp;Mr Cedric Lidzhade, who was named Limpopo&#39;s best principal in 2016, said that the former learners were a Godsend and an answer to their challenges. &quot;For years, we had a serious problem of water at the school. We still have many needs and if all come on board, learning and teaching would be highly improved at the school,&quot; he said.The school now has three boreholes, including the one donated by Mvula Trust, which is not yet fully operational.Staff, sponsors, pupils and guests pose for a photo during the handing-over ceremony at Mbilwi.The drought is over at Mbilwi Secondary School.
