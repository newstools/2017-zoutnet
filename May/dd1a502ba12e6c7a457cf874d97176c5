News - Date: 06 May 2017Written by: Mbulaheni Ridovhona / Viewed: 159EFF deputy president Floyd Shivambu married the love of his life, Siph&#39;esihle Pezi, on Saturday. The ceremony took place at Mahonisi Village outside Giyani.Shivambu&rsquo;s long-time friend, EFF president Julius Malema, joked and said that he could&nbsp;not bar EFF members from marrying ANC members, because all parties were African as long as they performed their official duties. (Pezi is an ANC member).&ldquo;These are the matters of the heart and nobody knows how he feels. We don&rsquo;t care who sleeps with whom, as long as they deliver work. If we choose for Floyd we will lose him, because he will be following his wife,&rdquo; Malema said.&ldquo;In the EFF we don&rsquo;t promote polygamy.&nbsp;You marry one wife and one husband. We also don&rsquo;t promote divorce and if you divorce know that we won&rsquo;t be part of it. Next time you want to marry, we won&rsquo;t come. You will just go to the magistrate and sign,&rdquo; Malema said.Malema also reiterated that there was no bad blood between him and Shivambu, as had been reported in some media outlets. Malema did not attend the first leg of the wedding, which was held last weekend in Cape Town and some people speculated that it was because of an internal feud.&ldquo;We are not fighting. I sent a delegation&nbsp;of the national leadership of the EFF to the Pezi family and I received a good report,&rdquo; Malema added.He also urged Pezi to look after Shivambu and understand that he has another family. &ldquo;Sometimes Floyd will be forced to attend meetings at night that you won&rsquo;t know about it and sometimes he will come with bags. Please don&rsquo;t open them, because you might find weapons inside,&rdquo; Malema said.Siph&#39;esihle works in the office of the National Speaker, Baleka Mbethe.Among the guests were Dr David Masondo, former deputy president of the ANC Youth League, Ronald Lamola and the Vhavenda king, Toni Mphephu Ramabulana.EFF deputy president Floyd Shivambu married the love of his life, Siph&#39;esihle Pezi.
