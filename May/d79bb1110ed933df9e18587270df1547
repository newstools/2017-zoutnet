The mayor visited Gundani village to inspect the progress of service delivery in the area. Gundani currently falls under Ward 11 and is one of the villages that were inherited by Musina from the now-defunct Mutale Municipality after last year&rsquo;s local government elections.Muhlope said she is on a drive to visit various areas within Musina Municipality personally to monitor service delivery. &ldquo;We have heard people complimenting the municipality on the good work during our public-participation activities. However, there were some community members who raised problems that need to be resolved. I find it very important&nbsp;to visit these areas personally to get first-hand information on how service delivery is being implemented.&rdquo;Maranda said he was honored to receive the mayor in his village.&nbsp; &ldquo;Though we work closely and in harmony with the local ward councilor, this clearly indicates that the municipality takes us very seriously. We are very fortunate to be blessed with political leaders who care and we promise to give them full support to bring a better life for all.&rdquo; &nbsp;Seated are Mayor Mihloti Muhlope and Headman Mphalaleni Maranda of Gundani village.
