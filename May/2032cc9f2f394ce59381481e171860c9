News - Date: 20 May 2017Written by: Ndivhuwo Musetha / Viewed: 47According to the World Health Organization, about 219 million people are infected by malaria worldwide every year. About 660&nbsp;000 of these people die, mainly children under the age of five living in Africa.In Limpopo, the Vhembe district has always been the most affected area.&nbsp; According to the MEC for Health, Dr Phophi Ramathuba, this is because of the high rainfall the area received and the extreme heat conditions. &ldquo;These two weather conditions make Vhembe&nbsp;favourable for malaria,&rdquo; she said.The MEC said&nbsp;malaria cases had decreased by 8&nbsp;000 cases last year.&nbsp; This resulted in a budget cut of R6 million this year. &ldquo;That was because we did well in the previous year in terms of combating malaria by spraying at people&rsquo;s homes. The heavy rain that we received from late last year until this year increased the cases of malaria, even in areas that never experienced it before.&rdquo;She also referred to a negative report by a radio news service, &ldquo;which said fumigation (spraying) is harmful to people and caused us a lot problems as some families refused to let our officials spray their homes. This led to a serious increase of malaria cases,&nbsp;which also resulted in shortages of medication at our clinics and hospitals,&rdquo; Ramathuba said.&ldquo;Following an intervention of the national department of health, our facilities are fully stocked with malaria medication,&rdquo; said&nbsp;Ramathuba.She emphasised that malaria is a dangerous disease that can kill if a victim is not treated in time. She strongly advises that when a person experiences symptoms such as headache, fever, shivering, joint pains, sweating, fatigue, mental confusion, fast heart rate and vomiting, they must immediately rush to the nearest clinic or hospital.Health MEC&nbsp;Dr Phophi Ramathuba.Email:
