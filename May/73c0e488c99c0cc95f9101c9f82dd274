News - Date: 07 May 2017Written by: Silas Nduvheni / Viewed: 364The rural community of Mahunguwi&nbsp;outside Thohoyandou has&nbsp;been separated from the nearby&nbsp;Tshitavha-Tsha Sambandou&nbsp;village&nbsp;after the bridge that linked&nbsp;the two villages was washed away by the heavy rains and floods that fell in the year 2000.The traditional leader of Mahunguwi village, Chief Mmbambadzeni Mphaphuli, said that as a result of the problems with the infrastructure, his communities were out of reach of government services.&ldquo;We informed the Department of Public Works to help fix the bridge, but they are sending us from pillar to post and we hope that coming to the media will help to solve the problems we are encountering. In 2014, some of the workers at the local Department of Public Works, Roads and Infrastructure made a slab. They never completed the project&nbsp;of fixing the bridge that will help to link us with other communities,&rdquo; said Mphaphuli.According to him, the Public Works workers promised to start up working on the bridge in April, but they never pitched up and the communities are still suffering.The spokesperson for the department of Public Works, Roads and Infrastructure, Mr Paina Galane, said the Mahunguwi bridge was rebuilt by using &ldquo;internal expertise,&rdquo; meaning workers from the local Vhembe Public Works. While busy with the job, the machines broke and had to go for repairs. &ldquo;We are happy to announce that the broken machines, such as the bulldozers, have&nbsp;been repaired and workers will be on site as from the beginning on May. We can assure the communities of Mahunguwi and learners that their lives will change for the better within a space of time,&rdquo; said Galane.Meanwhile, the MEC for Public Works, Roads and Infrastructure, Jerry Ndou,&nbsp;who&nbsp;recently visited the Vhembe region during the department&rsquo;s road show, informed the communities that&nbsp;his department was doing all it could&nbsp;to maintain the roads and bridges that had been damaged by heavy rains and floods.&nbsp;&nbsp;The traditional leader of Mahunguwi village, Chief Mmbambadzeni Mphaphuli.Communities in Mahunguwi village, led by the traditional leader of the area, Chief Mmbambadzeni Mphaphuli (far left), point&nbsp;out the collapsed bridge during Limpopo Mirror&#39;s visit.Email:
