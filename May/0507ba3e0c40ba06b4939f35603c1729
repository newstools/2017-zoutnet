News - Date: 27 May 2017Written by: Wilson Dzebu / Viewed: 87Mayor Mihloti Muhlope of Musina has called upon indigent community members to visit identified registration points to register for free services.The registration will take place from 22 May to 22 June on weekdays between 07:00 and 16:00. This is in preparation to update the indigent register for the new financial year, which starts on 1 July.Each beneficiary of the municipality&rsquo;s indigent policy receives 6 kilolitres of water, 55 kilowatts of electricity and 100%t free sewer and refuse-removal services every month. During the current financial year, the municipality is providing approximately 3 000 indigents with free services.Muhlope says indigents are people whose joint family monthly income is R3 500.00 or less. &ldquo;We subsidise these people with free services monthly, because we regard them as not financially viable and they need assistance to be able to sustain themselves. We urge our people to use this opportunity because there will be no further registration of indigents after 22 June.&rdquo;She says there are documents that people should keep handy in order to be successfully registered for the free services.&nbsp; &ldquo;These include an ID copy of applicant and spouse if married, copies of dependents&#39; birth certificates, recent municipal account, electricity meter number, proof of income in the form of payslip or bank statement and a sworn affidavit if the applicant is unemployed. Those who receive social grants must also provide proof thereof.&rdquo;She encourages community members to visit the following registration points: Matswale Clinic, Nancefield Gym, Nancefield and Skoonplaas municipal offices, Matswale municipal satellite office, Extension 10 SAPS satellite office, Harper, Campbell and municipal offices in town, Tshikhudini Musanda, Folovhodwe Community Hall, Madimbo Thusong Centre, Bale Care Group Centre, Mphephu Youth Centre (Tshipise), Muswodi Dipeni SAPS satellite office and Masisi Town Hall.Mayor Mihloti Muhlope of Musina.Email:
