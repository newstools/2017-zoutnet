He added that clean water, better roads and housing facilities were huge priorities for the municipality.According to Rambuda, there were many needs of the communities that the municipality should address, &ldquo;but we understand you cannot do them all at the same time.&rdquo; He said he was excited that, for the first time since the incorporation of parts of Mutale Municipality into Thulamela, an imbizo was being held. He expressed the hope that the leaders would listen to the pleas of the communities.One of the community members who attended the event, Mr Tshifhiwa Nekhubvi, said shortages of clean water, better roads and the promised RDP houses that had never been built&nbsp;in Gogogo village&nbsp;were some of the worrying factors for communities around. He also said that more than 100 RDP houses in Gogogo were abandoned by the contractor and a further 69 RDP houses were promised to be built&nbsp;in Gogogo in 2011, but that nothing had&nbsp;happened yet.Mayor Tshifhango said that the outcry of the communities about several issues needed to be addressed as a matter of urgency. He also presented food parcels to poor families identified by the ward councillor and the community development workers.Thulamela mayor&nbsp;Cllr Avhashoni Tshifhango greets Ms Freda Tshilande during the mayoral imbizo.
