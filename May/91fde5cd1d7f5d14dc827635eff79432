He urged the guests to make their parents happy while they were still alive,&nbsp;as directed by the Bible. &quot;The Bible says we should respect our parents and the elderly and we should do this if we are to receive God&#39;s favour. Let us do the best and f&ecirc;te them while they are alive,&quot; he said.He also praised the family for their contribution to development in their area. The couple&#39;s firstborn and only daughter, Ms Fulufhelo Netshifhefhe, said they felt as children they should honour and show love to their parents while they were still alive. &quot;Our parents have lived a very productive life and have impacted positively in many people&#39;s lives. They made a difference in many families, and as children we shall not forget what they have done for us.&rdquo;The Nephawe family having a good time during a thanksgiving ceremony held in honour of the parents at Makumeke.Thulamela Mayor&nbsp;Mushoni Tshifhango (left) and ANC Vhembe regional secretary Mr Khathu Netshifhefhe (right) wish&nbsp;the Nephawe couple well during the thanksgiving event at Makumeke.&nbsp; Elmon Tshikhudo started off as a photographer.
