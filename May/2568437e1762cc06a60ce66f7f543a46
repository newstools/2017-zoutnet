News - Date: 01 May 2017Written by: Wilson Dzebu / Viewed: 1089The construction of 158 housing units allocated to the rural areas of Musina by the Department of Cooperative Governance, Human Settlements and Traditional Affairs (Coghsta) is currently underway.The houses are to be built in villages such as Malale, Madimbo, Domboni, Tanda, Tshikhudini, Tshitanzhe, Bale, Maramanzhi, Musunda, Tshiungani, Matshena, Mbodi, Tshenzhelani and Bileni.The communications manager of the Musina Municipality, Mr Wilson Dzebu, said the right to adequate housing was one of the most important basic human rights. &ldquo;This is really a great step towards bringing a better life for all, since all the beneficiaries have never owned a house before. There is nothing more fulfilling than when a government puts a smile on an ordinary citizen&#39;s&nbsp;face.&rdquo;He added that as the&nbsp;local government closest to the people, Musina Municipality was required to promote and facilitate the provision of adequate housing in its jurisdiction within the framework of the national housing policy. &ldquo;Everyone has the right to have access to adequate housing and the government must take reasonable legislative and other measures, within our available resources, to achieve the progressive realization of this right.&rdquo;Dzebu said although the government had&nbsp;done a lot to bring a better life for all, there was still more to be done to restore the dignity of the people. &ldquo;We know that our people still have challenges in relation to water supply, sanitation, unemployment, crime, provision of electricity and roads. We will continue to face these challenges head-on to make sure that everyone enjoys the fruits of freedom.&rdquo;The construction of 158 housing units allocated to the rural areas of Musina is currently underway.
